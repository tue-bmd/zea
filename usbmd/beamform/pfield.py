"""
Pressure Field Computation for Ultrasound Imaging
=================================================

This module provides routines for automatic computation of the acoustic pressure field
used for compounding multiple transmit (Tx) events in ultrasound imaging.

The pressure field is computed by simulating the acoustic response of the probe and
medium for each transmit event. The computation involves:

- Subdividing each probe element into sub-elements to satisfy the Fraunhofer approximation.
- Calculating the distances and angles between each grid point and each sub-element.
- Computing the frequency response of the probe and the pulse spectrum.
- Summing the contributions from all relevant frequencies, taking into account
  transmit delays, apodization, and directivity.
- Optionally normalizing and thresholding the resulting field for use in
  transmit compounding or adaptive beamforming.

The main entry point is :func:`compute_pfield`, which returns a normalized pressure
field array for all transmit events.

            Higher is faster but less accurate.
        downsample (int, optional): Downsample the grid for faster computation.

        downmix (int, optional): Downmixing the frequency to facilitate a smaller grid.

            Only works when norm is True. Higher is more aggressive. Default is 10.
