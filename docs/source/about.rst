About
=====

``zea`` is a toolbox intended to support research towards cognitive ultrasound imaging, a concept described in :cite:t:`about-van2024active`. The idea is to close the action-perception loop in ultrasound imaging, where acquisition and reconstruction are tightly coupled to tackle some of the persistent challenges in the field of ultrasound imaging.

While the full realization of cognitive ultrasound imaging remains an ongoing effort, we hope this toolbox will help spur further research and development in the field.

.. note::
    **What's in a name?**

    It's just a name, but if we have to give it some meaning: ``zea`` is derived from the scientific name for corn, *Zea mays*, a staple food crop. Just as corn is a fundamental resource for many, we hope that ``zea`` will serve as a foundational tool for researchers in the field of cognitive ultrasound imaging. If you look at the logo, you can see that the kernels of the corn cob have some resemblance with either a sensing matrix or maybe the elements of an array. The high-dimensional and structured nature of the corn cob also reflects the complexity of ultrasound data (*long live LLMs!*).
